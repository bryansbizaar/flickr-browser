# 📸 Flickr Local Browser

A complete desktop application for downloading and browsing Flickr photo collections locally, with advanced search and album management capabilities.

> **Note**: This is a portfolio demonstration version of a custom application originally built for a private client. Personal data has been replaced with realistic demo content to showcase the technical implementation and user experience.

## 🧪 **Professional Testing Suite**

This project includes comprehensive testing demonstrating professional software engineering practices:

```bash
# Run the complete test suite
python run_tests.py
```

**Key Testing Features:**

- Database operations testing (many-to-many photo-album relationships)
- REST API endpoint validation
- Demo data generation quality assurance
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## 🎯 Quick Demo

**Want to see it in action immediately?**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flickr-local-browser
cd flickr-local-browser
python3 setup_portfolio_demo.py
python3 PORTFOLIO_LAUNCHER.py
```

The demo will automatically:

- Create 10 realistic photo albums
- Generate 400+ demo photos with rich metadata
- Set up a working photo browser interface
- Launch directly in your browser

## 🚀 Complete Setup Guide

### First Time Setup (Portfolio Demo)

1. **Clone & Navigate**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flickr-local-browser
   cd flickr-local-browser
   ```

2. **Setup Demo Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 setup_portfolio_demo.py
   ```

3. **Launch Application**
   ```bash
   python3 PORTFOLIO_LAUNCHER.py
   ```
   Browser opens automatically to `http://localhost:8080`

### For Live Flickr Integration (Optional)

For integration with actual Flickr account (requires API keys):

1. **Get Flickr API Credentials**

   - Visit [Flickr App Garden](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/)
   - Create new app and get API Key + Secret

2. **Run Live Downloader**

   ```bash
   python3 START_FLICKR_BROWSER.py
   ```

3. **Setup OAuth Authentication**
   - Follow browser prompts for Flickr authorization
   - Credentials saved securely for future use

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Backend (Python)**

- OAuth Authentication for private album access
- SQLite database with advanced many-to-many relationships
- Flask REST API with comprehensive endpoints
- Incremental update system for new photos

**Frontend (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)**

- Responsive photo grid interface
- Real-time search across titles/descriptions/tags
- Album filtering and navigation
- Modal photo detail views with metadata

**Key Technical Achievement: Database Design**

```sql
-- Advanced many-to-many photo-album relationships
CREATE TABLE photo_albums (
    photo_id TEXT,
    album_id TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (photo_id, album_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (photo_id) REFERENCES photos (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (album_id) REFERENCES albums (id)
);
```

This junction table design enables:

- Photos in multiple albums simultaneously
- Accurate album photo counts from relationships
- Efficient search across complex associations
- Perfect mirror of Flickr's actual data structure

## 🔍 Key Features

### Advanced Search & Filtering

- **Multi-field Search** - Across titles, descriptions, and tags simultaneously
- **Case-Insensitive Matching** - User-friendly search behavior
- **Album Filtering** - View photos from specific albums
- **Real-time Results** - Search results update immediately

### Database Management

- **Complex Relationship Modeling** - Many-to-many photo-album associations
- **Data Integrity** - Foreign key constraints and transaction safety
- **Query Optimization** - Efficient JOIN operations for photo retrieval
- **Incremental Updates** - Only downloads new photos on subsequent runs

### User Experience

- **Desktop Application** - No terminal commands needed for end users
- **Web-based Interface** - Familiar photo browsing experience
- **Offline Capability** - Browse complete collection without internet
- **Photo Metadata** - View titles, descriptions, tags, dates, view counts
